                        Jamii is a Community website founded by Rebekah Samuel and Sharon Powell. As Founders, we are committed to giving back to our Community and our mission is to drive and facilitate positive change. We hope to achieve this through collective understanding and mutual determination. As a new organisation, we look forward to growing and developing the support we can provide to our Community. For now, we encourage visitors and members to explore the great products and services within our Business Directory offered by black business owners. In our UPLIFT section (our Community Hub), you will find a variety of information such as news, knowledge, announcements, educational content, notification of events and more, all geared towards uplifting the Community.
