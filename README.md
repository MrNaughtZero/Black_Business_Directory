# Black Business Directory

Black Business Direcotory is a custom built Content Management System. The idea came to mind when I started working on a few bug fixes for a client on Fiverr. Sharon had contacted me initially to fix her navigation bar. There was an issue with the navigation not showing when a plugin was activated. But the rest of her website was dependant on this one plugin. After hours, I managed to fix the problem with the plugin, but then another issue arised soon after. Sharon had hired multiple developers, and each one installed an additional plugin. Putting a band aid on the website, temporarily - until the next problem arised.

Sharon had then wanted other features to be implemented. She wanted a bookstore, which would link direct to her Amazon account. She wanted a directory listing; so Black Owned Businesss could sign up, add their business details, and for them to be listed on the front-end of the website. Sharon had plans to charge a fee in the future for this. These were some of the features that she wanted implemented - and I couldn't offer this for her; since I am not a PHP Developer. Sure 9/10 times I can fix the issue you're having with Wordpress. Sure I can write up some code to query the database and fetch/insert some records; but I was not confident enough of creating this from scatch, and certainly not writing custom membership plugin to give certain users access to the directory.

So that is how Black Business Directory came around. I wanted to create something really similar to Wordpress, but with the features Sharon originally wanted. After all, I love writing Python code! I know it, I understand it, I love it!

The key features for Black Business Directory are:

* Blog System -> Admin should be able to create blog posts, and categorise them. On the front-end, there should be one global blog page, and indivual category pages.
* Bookstore -> Admin should be able to add Books to the bookstore, and for them to display on the front-end. The user should be redirected to Amazon via the affiliate link.
* Products -> Admin should be able to create products, and for them to be listed on the shop page. Admin should setup PayPal/Stripe payments on the backend. Potentially Crypto Payments
* Business Directory -> Admin should be able to add business information via the backend and they should display on the front-end.
* Business Directory: Panel -> Admin should be able to see all listed business's and change them.
* Business Directory USER -> User should be able to sign up, pay a fee and list so many business for free.
